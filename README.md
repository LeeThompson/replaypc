# replaypc
A simple text mode utility for extracting mpg files from ReplayTV Personal Video Recorders via TCP/IP.

This utility is Linux, Win32 and Mac OS X native, and is being developed with an eye for easy porting to other operating systems.

This is an archive of an old project from 2002 from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/replaypc/) that I'm importing here in case it vanishes there someday.
