# replaypc

**NOTE: This is an archive of an old project from 2002 from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/replaypc/) that I'm importing here in case it vanishes there someday.**


A simple text mode utility for extracting mpg files from ReplayTV Personal Video Recorders via TCP/IP.

This utility is Linux, Win32 and Mac OS X native, and is being developed with an eye for easy porting to other operating systems.

Project Contributors: Matthew Linehan, Todd Larason, Lee Thompson, David Noel, Randy Saunders, King of Bayonne


The Windows version of ReplayPC is built using MSVC++ 6.0 on a Win2K system by Matt Linehan who can be reached at ~~mlinehan@users.sourceforge.net~~. To build the Windows version of ReplayPC, in Microsoft Visual C++, create a new "Win32 Console Application" called ReplayPC. Tell the wizard that you want an empty project. Add the ReplayPC.cpp source file to the project and build it.
