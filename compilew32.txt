Compiling ReplayPC 0.4 on Win32.

OpenSSL is now required.

1. Download the OpenSSL source distribution.  http://www.openssl.org
2. Follow the OpenSSL instructions to build it, we really only care about libeay32.dll
3. Create an 'openssl' directory under the ReplayPC project.   Copy from the OpenSSL distribution the following files:

	MakeFile
	md5.c
	md5.h
	md5_dgst.c
	md5_locl.h
	md5_one.c
	md5s.cpp
	md5test.c
	libeay32.exp
	libeay32.dll (which you compiled in step 2)
	libeay32.lib (which you compiled in step 2)
	
	And the ASM subdirectory.




To build ReplayPC 0.4:

1. Open the workspace (DSW) in Visual Studio
2. Make the project you want to compile active, it defaults to "ALL"
3. Select the configuration (Debug or Release)
4. Select "Rebuild All"
5. All the binaries should now be in the "Debug" or "Release" subdirectory (depending which configuration you selected)
