To build the Win32 version using NMAKE:

1. Copy all of the contents of this (Makefiles) folder up one level.
2. Type "buildw32" (or double click) to build the binaries, they will be copied to the Dist folder.


NOTES:
	Both "rddns" and "crypttest" require OpenSSL.
	These two projects are not included in the "ALL" Makefile or Workspace.
